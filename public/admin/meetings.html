    <p>After the traditional <a href="/suoc/misc/joke.html">joke of
    the week</a> and general announcements, we tell stories of the
    trips that went out the previous weekend, with the most
    entertaining story being honored by the club trophy (woooh
    wooh!). Then we find out about trips that are going out the
    following weekend, and maybe wrap up with a slideshow featuring
    a previous club trip or "what I hiked/climbed/biked/paddled on
    my summer holiday".</p>

    <p>If you want to go on one of the trips, put your name and
    number on the sign-up sheet provided. There is usually a limit
    to how many people can go on a trip, and positions are assigned
    on a first-come first-served basis. Feel free to sign up past
    the limit, so if people can't make it we can call you. Also,
    make sure you call the leader if you can't make it so that
    someone else can take your place.</p>

    <p>After meeting activities may include: Ice Skating, Swimming
    or anything else that comes to mind.</p>

    <p>The first meeting of every semester is held during the
    second week of classes and features an introduction to the club
    and a slide show of <a href=
    "/images/pictures/slideshow.html">really cool pictures of
    SUOC activities</a> to entice you to join and have a great
    time. So come along and check it out!</p>
