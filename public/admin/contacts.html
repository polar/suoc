  <p>The best way to find out about the club is to come to one of
  our <a href="meetings.html">weekly meetings</a>. You can also
  visit us up at the <a href="../eroom/eroom.html">Equipment
  Room</a>.</p>

  <p>If you can't make the meetings or the E-Room times, you can
  call one of the <a href="officers.html">Club Officers</a> to find
  out how to join. Or check out the list of <a href=
  "/?page=trips">trips going out this week</a>, and if you find
  one you like, call the trip leader to see if you can go.</p>

  <p>Or you can contact us at:</p>
