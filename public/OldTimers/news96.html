<a name="weddings"><b>Weddings</b> <em> 28 October 1996 </em>
<dd>
<p>
Okay, I've been really lax, so as not to recap all the weddings I went to
this year, I'll just mention them. Mike Rodriguez married Jennifer Spence in
a heartfelt cerimony on the Oregon coast. I mean right on the coast. Suits
and barefoot in the sand. Heide (Helga) Novado married Eric on the 
Cape in August shortly after Mike. Barb finally gave into Paul Coddington
and they got married in Pennsylvania on Labor Day weekend. Brian Manahan
and Carrie Levine got married in Maine, and Tom Merkel finally got married
at a humungous galla affair in Grand Rapids. At three o'clock in the morning
closing a bar after his wedding, we asked Tom to go get something to eat. Tom
got ready and then, thought a bit, and said, "noooo... I GOTTA go home!".
Almost got him. And finally, Mary Gerber got married this past weekend
in good old Syracuse.  Well, that was the last one of the year, so far.
<p>
Big gap for news here. Sorry
<p>

<a name="marla"><b>Marla and Scott's Twins 1 year old.</b> <em> 16 July 1996 </em>
<dd>
Well, a bday party was had last weekend at the Wheeler, er, Silver's residence, 
in surburbia Phili, West Chester (east of Chester). The twins, Ethan and
Erin, are now 1 year old. After the entire Silver family arrived (<em>Gad! And 
they say Catholics breed like rabbits!</em>) and had left, Scott and Marla 
were more than just one year older.
<p>
However, Scott still wanting to keep in shape for the Pan Mass Challenge,<strong> 
Send Scott fifty bucks ($50.00)</strong>, got Stanky and myself (Polar), to do
a fifty mile bike ride in 90 degree heat, with 100% humity, in the 
hills of Pennsylvania just to prove we were men. Matt Stillerman decided to 
lay about the pool that afternoon. 
<p>
It was a good ride, lots-o-hills, lots-o-sweat. 
I almost died of heat exhaustion. I just kept thinking of
the pool back at the house...the pool that Marla keeps at 82 degrees for the
twins..... I almost died of heat exhaustion. 
<p>
It was a good weekend, we even did a little house reconstruction.

<a name="heather"><b>Heather Mirzcak's Kayaking Trip to Alaska with Martin Barbor</b> <em> 6 June 1996</em>
<dd>
Since Heather didn't send this to me electronically, 
I will type in a couple of excerpts.
<p>
An old friend from SUOC called me up looking for a 4th paddler for his trip. 
(those OldTimer's lists pay off!). The group was Martin [Barbor], his wife
Nancy, and Brian, a friend of theirs. Brian is a laid back, funny guy, and
we quickly fell into place. For diving into a two week experience with
folks I didn't know, it went great.
<p>
The Beardless: A cluster of islands. Tall stands of mature hemlock and spruce,
all the same age as the glaciers that cleared everthing at one time. The woods 
are wrapped in moss, covering the trees and ground. It is so quiet once you
step "inland". The forest floor, thick and spongy, is moist and soft to the touch. 
Sunlight is sparse, filtering through the canopy of
firs high above your head. It is an enchanted world, the textures
and hues folding into each other, a sea of green. It draws you in,
and you need to stop for a moment to remember where you are! Yet another
face of Alaska.
<p>
We leave the Beardlees and head into the heart of the arm, to the Glaciers!
As you get further into the park the mountains are highter,
the snow is deeper, the air is colder and the vegetation is less. I wonder how
things survive here. The glaciation is all around you, The hanging U
shaped valleys, the scoured rock, the rounded curve of the faces that shoot
up to jagged snow capped peaks.  The mountains are towering, their walls rise
straight up from the waters edge. We are small, no more
than a speck on the water to the cruise ships that drone past. We see it all
like the seal or the sea otter. There is only a thin wall of fiberglass
separating us from the 38 degree water.  The landscape is severe, bold, and 
magnificent.  The sun shines on the snow and its blinding. We are in T-shirts,
paddling around in this world of rock. Lichens are the only vegetation and
snow still covers the beaches we intend to camp on. Chunks of ice are floating
in the water. Depending on the day, the time, the tide, you need to weave
your boat through them, and it's really cool.
<p>
Then there we were, the face of a glacier, the Lamplough Glacier.  I was not
really prepared for the sight, I'm not sure I even comprehended that I would
be seeing glaciers in this park.  I realize the name is a dead giveaway, but
I hadn't spent time processing what that meant. Here it was in front of me now,
the reason, the force behind the beauty, the jewel of our peices. It's white
and snowy, It begins to get more solid and stripe, bands of gray and white,
some thick, some thin, being so tightly pushed together and compressed
until you hit that crystal clear blue section near the base. The snow has been
compressed so tightly, the air has been squeezed out and only solid ice remains.
It's beautiful, it's magnanimous, ominous, looming, brilliant, amazing.
It's a galcier. Our jaws droppped. Had I been expecting it, I still don't think
I would have been prepared for that sight. I mean, how many of us really get
to stand next to a river of ice in our lifetime, yet we live 
our daily lives in a place carved out by them! It was truly awesome, and I 
recommend the experience to anyone.
<p>
Next to seeing the Glaciers, I have two other events imprinted on my brain
that I will refer to as my most splendid moments! One is the image of the
grizzly bear that go within 40 feet of us! It's quite a story, and quite
an image! We were eating dinner on the beach, and it is our 3rd night out.
We have seen no bears yet, we have put in 3 long paddle days,
and we are practically at our first glacier. We are relaxed, maybe too soon, for 
all our food containers are open, and we are cooking up a tasty meal. We 
are all sitting around the stove, when Martin yells, "Grizzly!!" We look up
to see this huge brown bear's face coming over the little rise off to our
right. The sun is at our backs and it illuminates this bear to a bronze honey 
color.  I can clearly define its two dark eyes, its small ears, the very blond 
ring of hair encricling its face, the black nose... and its haunches in full 
swing.  This bear is running, galloping I's say straight at us. A grizzly, 
the mother of bears, running at us... OH MY GOD!!! In unison we all stood 
right up, and out of initial instinct we all spun around, I can tell you my 
legs were already in motion. As my legs started out from under me, the logical 
brain was kicking in.. "don't run..where are you gonna go?" I turned around to 
catch that golden butt of the grizzly taking off the way it had come! 
What a sight! We startled that creature as badly as it did us! We watched him 
run down the beach, up the rocks, down the rock, into the water, swim around, 
back out and then up over the hill. It was with that encounter that I saw 
myself as an intruder into this land. I mean after all, that bear was cruising 
down the beach for dinner, or just using it as a means of travel to another 
destination, but got stopped. We flustered at that poor bear.  I can of course 
say that and feel that in hind site. My adrenaline at the moment of that encounter
was off the chart! We had two other encounters with grizzlies on that beach..
and our bear etiquette was in tip top shape from that moment on, but I tell
you that is a golden image that I will have emblazon on my brain for quite
some time!

Wed night to Sunday<br>
We had more meat than we could consume.<br>
Weather warm, sunny, mild wind, blue sky, full moon, few bugs, rain on last 
day.<br>
<p>
Wed night, Arrive at car campsite at 1am, Ed and Jeanne at 3am. They went 
through Montreal, got lost, and claim the French dont know what Ottawa is.
Thurs paddle into big burnt lake and passed up several fine campsites for a 
sloping shitty one. Set up a base camp, for one night, moved the following 
morning to a better sight.
<p>
At noon friday we set off for a long loop to explore a big bog and find 
moose. Spotted four moose total. Watched the sunset on big trout lake at the 
halfway point in the day trip. Continued by moonlight through uncountable 
portages. Woke up a camper as we paddled back to our camp, 
<p>
Camper: You guys looking for a campsite
<br>
Us: No, we have one
<br>
Camper: you guys need a map
<br>
Us: We're ok. What time is it?
<br>
Camper: Just a second, 4am.
<br>
Us: laughs and giggles, geezes and shits.
<p>
We arrived at our campsite as the sky began to get light in the east. Later 
we were to find out our day loop was normally done in 3 days. Things bigger 
in canada. Total 13 portages that day.
<p>
Next day: Up at crack of noon. Glenna & I in search of more moose. Ed still 
snoring, claims he's tired and justs wants to hang. Jeanne stays by his side 
<p>
Next day: Up at crack of noon. Glenna & I in search of more moose. Ed still 
snoring, claims he's tired and justs wants to hang. Jeanne stays by his side 
to make sure he doesn't fall asleep and roll into the lake and drown.
No moose found, Back to camp where Ed & Jeanne cook an entire side of beef. 
<p>
We have it for breakfast next day.
<p>
Back to the car, just starting to rain.
Spot half a dozen moose on the drive out.
Back to usa 3-4 am Monday morning.
Great park. Highly recommended. Double all time estimates.

<a name="bjorns wedding"><b>Jannette's Account of Bjorn's Wedding</b> <em> 24 May 1996</em> </a>
<dd>
Hi SUOCers,
<p>
Just thought I'd pass on the good news that Bjorn Liencres is now
married to Michele Einloth.  They had a beautiful outdoor ceremony at
the Ahwahnee hotel in Yosemite National Park.  They said their vows with
Yosemite Falls in the background behind them.  They're honeymooning in
Fiji.  Bjorn quit working for Sun and is now involved in a small startup
company - no outside email address yet as far as I know.  The weather
was gorgeous for the wedding, and we stayed at Yosemite for a few more
days until they had rain and floods and we had to be evacuated from our
cottage at Yosemite Lodge in the middle of the night and be stranded in
the cafeteria.  Luckily they opened the roads by that evening and we got
out before it rained again.

<a name="wva"><b>West Virginia</b> <em>10 March 1996</em> </a>
<dd>
Well, I went to W.Va with the SUOC Spring Break group down at good old 
Thorn Spring Park. The only other old timer that went down was 
Martin Barbour, who got stuck taking caving trip after caving trip. 
That's what he gets for taking a vacation without his wife!
<p>
This was my 14th trip in 16 years (I bagged the last two years).
As for you who remember the days of yesteryear, the park on a whole looks
the same, but the cabins are quite nice. Every one has a working toliet
and shower with unbelievably hot water, and each has a wood stove. Bunks 
are still the same, and there is a shower/shit house that is rugged, yet 
nice, and almost above the flood line for the creek. 
<p>
The big two story cabin with the porch got torn down last year 
and a brand new log cabin is built in its place. However, the new cabin is 
only one story, and it is really three separate rooms, sort of like a 
motel. We didn't stay in that one.
<p>
We did stay in the end three cabins, including good old cabin #9, the 
other big cabin. Seems like the same stuff is still going on. Those
of you who use to talk to the Waggy's to get into BullStud or "Dog doo"
Cave, will remember that they seemed to be collecting garbage in the house.
That garbage is now chest deep, of such things like compressed cereal boxes,
newspapers, etc. Jeezz. Looks like they might sell the farm. All the kids are
in college and away from the farm.
<p>
Sinnit-Thorn cave is now out of the hands of the Propps, and in the hands of
the NSS. So, getting in the cave is a pain. However, not when you know 
the combination. Hee Hee.
<p>
I brought boats down this year, and took quite a few beginners down on
the Narrows section of the Cheat River, and it was quite high, alot
of roller coasters. I got to see the eyes bug out of these beginners 
at the size of the waves and the coldness of the water. Great Fun. 
Looks like we might have a few new water enthusiasts.
<p>
Grant and Edna are still alive and the place is the same as ever, except
for the new two lane bridge over the creek. The old green tressle is gone,
said it wasn't strong enough to hold the school buses anymore. Grant, the
really old guy in the corner, actually tried to get out his fiddle one
afternoon. Oh the days, when he could really play!
<p>
It was a great time. Sometime, we should all take a nostalgia trip down there
and do some caves, rivers, and climbing at Seneca Rocks. It's really fun
to read all the old shit everybody wrote in the Journals at Edna's, like Danny
Edlestein, Stacy Dodd, etc.

Winterlude in Ottawa, was again a nice success, even though  
Kristin and Polar were the only ones who went skiing in the Gateneaux. 
The ice more or less sucked, since it got warm on Thursday and Friday, 
only to freeze into little bumps and holes by Saturday. Most of the snow and 
ice sculptures were melting. This was interesting because I always wondered 
what the Winterlude looked like it was all over. Most people did the Ottawa
city thing, i.e. going to museums, etc. Good time, and dinner on Saturday 
night was, as usual, fantastic.  
<p>
Sunday, Jonathan, Janette, Bill, Mary, Kristin, and Thea found this 
great Italian resturant called <em>The Ritz</em>. We should remember this
one for an alternative to Demitris.

for the festivities.
We were the only ones back in there since mid November. We had quite a
party, let me tell you. We actually found some wood and made a fire. It 
went out around 8 or 9 o'clock, and we consequently went to bed. Whew!
