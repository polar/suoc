<h3>Club Memberships</h3>
<p>
Memberships are from September of the previous year to the September of the specified year. The "year" is the year the membership ends.
For example, a 2011 membership signifies membership that ends on August 31, 2011. There are two types
of membershps, "Year" and "Spring". Usually the Year membership is sold in the fall, and the Spring membership
is sold in the spring.

Note, the total is for the membership year, and it does not signify the actual money collected
for memberships during a fiscal year. Please see the Account Reports for fiscal information. This
total is presented here to aid in solving some accounting anamolies, if they exist.

<h3>Slackers</h3>
<p>
Slackers are people that have been registered on more than one trip and do not
have a recorded membership for a given year regardless of their stated Club Status,
e.g. "Active", "Inactive", "Life", etc.
<p>
Note, people may have been registered for a trip, but that does not mean they actually went on that trip.
Contraversally, there may be people who have not been registered for more than one trip,
have not paid their specified membership, and went on more trips, due to lack in trip registrations.
People who were not registered on more than one trip for the specified year will not show up here.
<p>
This information is historical regardless of Club Member status.
There is no date associated with a Club Member's status as they may change it at will.
People who are Life members that did not pay will show up for that year if you click
the life box, so you may check to see if they actually got a membership for that particular year.
