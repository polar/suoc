This directory contains symbolic links made by

% ln -s -f ../plugins/*_engine/engine_plugins/* .

Rails config will load two plugins with the same name if they are
found in two different "plugin_paths".

However, some plugins do not play nice when loaded twice. 
  paginating_find is a prime example. 
If loaded twice it ends up recursive chaining find methods.

We create this directory and use the symbolic links to
mitigate the duplicates, and we just modify the Rails
configuration plugin path to:

    config.plugin_paths += ["#{RAILS_ROOT}/vendor/engine_plugins"]
